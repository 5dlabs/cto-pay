# PRD: On-Chain Usage-Based Billing for CTO

**Author:** 5D Labs
**Status:** Draft
**Target:** Solana Agent Hackathon (April 2026)
**Branch:** `claude/solana-agent-hackathon-oY0EF`

---

## 1. Problem statement

CTO's existing monetization model (defined in `docs/business/saas-monetization.md`)
relies on traditional SaaS billing: platform subscription fees, CodeRun overage
charges, and optional managed-key token pass-through, all settled off-chain via
conventional payment processors.

This creates three gaps:

1. **No verifiable billing.** Customers cannot independently verify that their
   usage charges are accurate. They trust 5D Labs' billing system.
2. **No composable payment rail.** If CTO ever opens to third-party skill
   authors or an agent marketplace, there is no programmatic way to split
   payments across multiple recipients atomically.
3. **No on-chain presence.** CTO's value proposition is autonomous AI agents
   running production workloads, but none of that economic activity is visible
   or settleable on chain — a missed opportunity in the Solana ecosystem.

## 2. Proposed solution

Build a **Solana program** that settles CTO usage-based billing on chain,
with an integrated quality-gated marketplace for third-party skills.

Customers pre-pay into an escrow account. The CTO runtime reports usage per
task. The program debits the customer's balance and writes an itemized
on-chain receipt. When a task uses a **public agent package** published by a
third-party author, the program conditionally splits payment between 5D Labs
and the agent author — but only if the task meets a quality threshold
(attestations from CTO's review agents). If quality isn't met, the customer
doesn't pay.

The marketplace is not a separate system — it's a conditional split inside
the same settlement instruction. Since we're already measuring quality for
billing purposes, routing a portion of successful payments to agent authors
is one extra branch, not a new project.

This is not a hackathon toy — it is intended to become a real billing rail
that runs alongside (and eventually replaces) traditional payment processing
for usage-based charges.

## 3. Goals

- Demonstrate end-to-end on-chain settlement of a CTO task at the hackathon.
- Demonstrate quality-gated marketplace splits: a public agent author gets
  paid only when the task meets quality thresholds.
- Produce a Solana program that can be extended post-hackathon into a
  production billing layer with a growing ecosystem of third-party skills.

## 3a. Design principles

- **Decentralized-first.** When choosing between a centralized and a
  decentralized approach for any component, prefer the decentralized option
  unless it makes the hackathon demo technically infeasible. This applies to
  storage (Arweave / IPFS over S3 / SeaweedFS), identity (wallet-based over
  OAuth), data availability (on-chain or permanent storage over ephemeral
  databases), and coordination (program-enforced splits over off-chain
  accounting). A Solana hackathon rewards on-chain-native thinking; leaning
  into decentralized infrastructure earns credibility with judges and aligns
  with the long-term architecture.
- **Verifiable by default.** Every economic event should produce an
  independently verifiable artifact — an on-chain transaction, a content-
  addressed receipt, or a signed attestation.
- **Composable over monolithic.** Prefer small, well-defined instructions that
  external programs and clients can compose, over large instructions that
  internalize workflow logic.

## 4. Non-goals (for the hackathon)

- NFT-based authorship tokens or receipt tokens.
- Subscription tier management on chain (subscriptions stay off-chain).
- Managed-key LLM token pass-through billing (BYOK customers pay their
  LLM provider directly; that cost is out of scope for on-chain settlement).
- Full skill discovery UI / leaderboard / search (the on-chain primitive
  exists; the frontend comes later).
- Production-grade security audit of the Solana program.

## 5. Background: existing billing model

From `docs/business/saas-monetization.md`, the chosen model is **hybrid
pricing** (platform subscription + usage-based components):

| Tier | Platform fee | Included CodeRuns | Overage | AI keys |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Free | $0 | 50/month | $3.00/run | BYOK only |
| Team | $199/month | 200/month | $1.50/run | BYOK or managed (+15%) |
| Growth | $499/month | 1,000/month | $0.75/run | BYOK or managed (+10%) |
| Enterprise | Custom | Custom | $0.50/run | Flexible |

**Billing dimensions today (all off-chain):**

1. **CodeRun execution** — time from pod start to completion.
2. **AI tokens** — pass-through + margin when using 5D Labs managed keys.
3. **Infrastructure compute** — bare-metal time (standard / high-mem / GPU).

**Key architectural facts:**

- Provider model supports Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Cursor, Factory,
  Moonshot with a 5-level resolution precedence (CRD field → legacy
  settings → operator config → model inference → Fireworks fallback).
  See `crates/controller/src/tasks/code/resources.rs`.
- Secrets flow: 1Password → OpenBao → External Secrets Operator → K8s
  Secrets → pod env vars. See `docs/secrets-management.md`.
- API keys per provider via `Provider::secret_key()` in
  `crates/controller/src/cli/types.rs`.

## 6. What goes on chain

### 6.1. Customer balance (escrow PDA)

- Customer tops up a **balance PDA** with USDC (SPL token).
- The program is the sole authority over the PDA; no external party holds
  the key.
- Balance is debitable only by the CTO runtime's authorized signer (the
  **operator wallet**, controlled by 5D Labs).
- Customer can withdraw unused balance at any time.

### 6.2. Agent package registration (public marketplace)

Third-party authors can register **agent packages** on chain. An agent
package is the full bundle needed to run an agent on CTO's runtime:

- **Skills** — reusable capabilities from `skills/`
- **Tools** — MCP server configs, GitHub repo references
- **SOUL.md** — agent personality, identity, and behavioral guidelines
- **USER.md** — user context and preferences
- **AGENT.md** — agent specification and role definition
- **Any other config** relevant to OpenClaw or Hermes (CTO's agent
  runtimes)

An `AgentPackage` PDA stores the author's wallet, a split percentage
(basis points), a content-addressed reference to the package source, and
a SHA-256 content hash for integrity verification. The `source_uri`
should be an Arweave transaction ID (`ar://...`) uploaded via Irys —
preferred per §3a decentralized-first principle — ensuring permanent,
tamper-proof availability. Repo URLs are acceptable during development.
Registration is permissionless — anyone can publish.

When a customer's task uses a public agent package, the `settle_task`
instruction includes the package's PDA. The program uses it to route a
portion of payment to the author — but only if quality is met (see 6.3).

Default agents (5D Labs' own roster: Rex, Blaze, Tess, etc.) are
registered the same way, with 5D Labs as the author wallet. **One code
path for everything.** The only difference between a "default" and a
"public" agent is whose wallet the author field points to.

### 6.3. Task settlement (with quality-gated marketplace split)

When a `CodeRun` completes, the CTO controller submits a **settle_task**
instruction to the program with:

- `task_id` — Linear issue ID or internal identifier.
- `customer` — customer's pubkey (linked via CTO profile).
- `amount` — the billable amount in USDC.
- `receipt_hash` — hash of a JSON receipt blob stored off-chain (Arweave
  via Irys/Bundlr — preferred per §3a decentralized-first principle)
  containing the itemized breakdown.
- `skill_author` — (optional) pubkey of the public agent author, if a
  third-party skill was used.
- `author_split_bps` — (optional) basis points for the author's share
  (e.g. 3000 = 30%).
- `quality_met` — boolean indicating whether the task passed the quality
  threshold (Tess/Cipher/Stitch attestations).

The program evaluates three cases:

**Case 1: No public agent package (default agents only)**
1. Verifies operator wallet signature.
2. Debits `amount` from customer balance.
3. Credits 100% to operator treasury (5D Labs).
4. Writes `TaskReceipt`.

**Case 2: Public skill used, quality threshold MET**
1. Verifies operator wallet signature.
2. Debits `amount` from customer balance.
3. Splits payment: `author_split_bps` to agent author wallet, remainder
   to operator treasury.
4. Writes `TaskReceipt` with `author_earned > 0` and `quality_met = true`.

**Case 3: Public skill used, quality threshold NOT MET**
1. Customer is **not charged** (no debit). The task effectively costs
   nothing.
2. Skill author earns nothing.
3. Writes `TaskReceipt` with `amount = 0`, `author_earned = 0`,
   `quality_met = false`.

This creates aligned incentives:
- **Skill authors** are incentivized to publish high-quality skills —
  they only earn when their skill contributes to a successful task.
- **Customers** are protected — they don't pay for failed work when
  using public agent packages, which makes them willing to experiment.
- **5D Labs** gets a marketplace for free inside the billing rail,
  taking a cut on every successful public-skill settlement.

> **Note:** Case 3 (customer pays nothing on failure) is the boldest
> version and strongest for the hackathon pitch. For production, this
> may be refined to charge a base compute fee while zeroing the author's
> portion — see section 7.6.

### 6.4. On-chain receipt

Each settled task produces a `TaskReceipt` account (or PDA keyed by
task ID) that the customer can look up in any Solana explorer to verify:

- Which task was billed.
- How much was charged.
- Whether a public agent package was used and how much the author earned.
- Whether the quality threshold was met.
- When settlement occurred.
- The receipt hash, which they can resolve off-chain to see the full
  itemized breakdown (CodeRun minutes, infra compute, etc.).

## 7. Open design questions

These are the genuinely unsolved problems. The hackathon submission should
take a position on each, but they remain open for iteration.

### 7.1. What is the billing unit?

Candidates, from coarsest to most granular:

| Unit | Description | Tradeoff |
|---|---|---|
| Per task (flat) | Fixed price per CodeRun regardless of duration | Simple but doesn't reflect actual cost |
| Per task (metered) | Price based on CodeRun duration + infra tier | Matches existing billing dimensions |
| Per successful task | Only charge when attestations confirm success | Best customer UX, but exposes runtime to abuse |
| Hybrid | Base attempt fee + success bonus | Balances abuse protection and customer trust |

The existing monetization doc prices by **CodeRun count + duration**, so
"per task (metered)" is the natural starting point. Whether to condition
payment on task success is the key open question.

### 7.2. How is success measured?

CTO already has review agents that produce pass/fail signals:

- **Tess** — tests pass.
- **Cipher** — security audit clean.
- **Stitch** — code review approved, PR merged.

These signals could be lifted on chain as **attestations** that the billing
program reads to decide whether to release or refund payment. This is not
required for the hackathon MVP but is the natural extension.

Design sub-questions if we go this route:

- Which agents count as success-signers? Tess alone? Tess + Cipher? All
  three?
- What's the quorum — 2-of-3, all-of-3, weighted?
- Does a failed attestation trigger full refund, partial refund, or just
  a reduced charge (compute cost only)?
- How is "success" defined per task type? (A bug fix vs. a greenfield
  feature vs. a refactor have different success criteria.)

### 7.3. Trust model for usage reporting

All usage measurements (CodeRun duration, infra time, skill invocation
counts) happen **off-chain** in CTO's Kubernetes cluster. The Solana
program accepts them as truth from the operator wallet. This means the
customer trusts 5D Labs to report honestly.

For the hackathon, this is acceptable. For production, trust-reduction
options include:

- **Signed receipts per agent pod.** Each pod holds a per-task keypair;
  usage is signed by the pod, not a central aggregator.
- **Review-agent co-signatures.** Tess/Cipher attest to usage totals as
  part of their task attestation, making them complicit if numbers are
  wrong.
- **Open-source runtime.** Customers can inspect metering logic (relevant
  now that the platform is going open source).
- **Dispute mechanism.** Customer can challenge a task's usage; if proven
  fraudulent, operator stake gets slashed.

### 7.4. Customer payment UX

Three patterns, ranked by real-world usability:

1. **Pre-paid balance (AWS credits)** — customer tops up once, runtime
   debits per task silently. Best for real customers. Requires a
   `deposit` and `withdraw` instruction on the program.
2. **Session key delegation** — customer signs once, delegates spending
   authority to CTO for a capped amount over a time window. Modern
   Solana pattern. Good for demo.
3. **Per-task escrow** — customer signs per task. Maximum on-chain
   visibility but worst UX at scale.

Hackathon demo can use #2 or #3. Production should converge on #1.

### 7.5. Spending controls

Customers need guardrails:

- **Max per task** — program rejects settlement above this cap.
- **Max per day / per month** — rolling spending limit enforced by the
  program.
- **Pre-flight estimate** — runtime shows estimated cost before task
  execution, customer approves (off-chain UX, not a program instruction).

### 7.6. Failure and refund handling

- Task fails before any agent work → full refund (no settlement submitted).
- Task fails after partial work (e.g., implementation done, tests fail) →
  open question: charge for compute consumed, or refund fully?
- Task succeeds per attestations → full charge per usage.
- Customer disputes a charge → manual resolution initially, on-chain
  dispute mechanism later.

### Instructions

```
initialize_operator(authority, treasury, protocol_fee_bps)
  → Creates OperatorConfig PDA.

register_agent_package(package_id, split_bps, source_uri, content_hash)
  → Called by the author. Creates AgentPackage PDA with the signer as
     author. `source_uri` should be an Arweave URI (`ar://txid`) for
     permanent decentralized storage; `content_hash` is the SHA-256 of
     the package bundle at that URI. Permissionless — anyone can publish.

update_agent_package(source_uri, content_hash, split_bps, active)
  → Called by the author. Updates their package metadata. When updating
     the source, both `source_uri` and `content_hash` must be provided
     together to maintain integrity.

create_customer_account(max_per_task, max_per_day)
  → Creates CustomerBalance PDA for the signing customer.

deposit(amount)
  → Transfers USDC from customer's token account to the program vault.
     Increments customer balance.

withdraw(amount)
  → Transfers USDC from program vault back to customer.
     Decrements customer balance.

settle_task(task_id, amount, receipt_hash, agent_package?, quality_met)
  → Called by operator wallet.
     Validates: operator is authorized, customer has sufficient balance,
     amount is within per-task and daily caps.
     If agent_package is provided and quality_met is true:
       Splits payment — author_split_bps to author wallet, rest to treasury.
       Increments AgentPackage.total_earned, task_count, success_count.
     If agent_package is provided and quality_met is false:
       Customer is not charged (amount = 0). Author earns nothing.
       Increments AgentPackage.task_count only.
     If no agent_package:
       Debits full amount, credits operator treasury.
     Writes TaskReceipt in all cases.

refund_task(task_id)
  → Called by operator wallet.
     Marks TaskReceipt as Refunded. Credits amount back to customer balance.

update_spending_caps(max_per_task, max_per_day)
  → Called by customer. Updates their caps.

pause / unpause
  → Called by operator. Circuit breaker for emergencies.
```

## 9. Controller integration points

The CTO Kubernetes controller needs minimal changes to submit settlement
transactions:

### 9.1. New config

Add Solana RPC endpoint and operator keypair path to the controller config
(`crates/controller/src/tasks/config.rs`). The operator keypair should be
managed via the existing OpenBao secrets pipeline.

### 9.2. Settlement hook

In `crates/controller/src/tasks/code/controller.rs`, after a `CodeRun`
transitions to a terminal state (merged / failed / cancelled), the
controller:

1. Computes the billable amount from pod duration + infra tier.
2. Builds the itemized receipt JSON and uploads to Arweave via Irys
   (content-addressed, permanent, decentralized — per §3a).
3. Hashes the receipt.
4. Submits a `settle_task` (or `refund_task` on failure) instruction to
   the Solana program.
5. Records the transaction signature on the `CodeRun` status for
   traceability.

### 9.3. Customer wallet mapping

The customer's Solana pubkey needs to be associated with their CTO
account. For the hackathon, this can be a simple field in the customer
profile. For production, wallet linking via Solana wallet-adapter
(`@solana/wallet-adapter`) with signature verification.

## 10. Future extensions (post-hackathon, not in scope)

These are documented for context but are explicitly **not part of the
hackathon build**:

### 10.1. Authorship NFTs

Each registered agent package is represented by a transferable NFT.
Whoever holds the NFT receives the royalty stream. Transfer the NFT =
sell the revenue-generating agent as an asset on secondary markets.

### 10.2. On-chain attestations (trustless quality)

Tess, Cipher, and Stitch hold Solana keypairs. Their pass/fail signals
become on-chain attestations. The billing program gates payment release
on a quorum of attestation signatures, removing trust in the operator
for quality determination. (In the hackathon build, the operator reports
`quality_met` — this extension makes it trustless.)

### 10.3. Agent reputation and leaderboards

The `AgentPackage` account already tracks `total_earned`, `task_count`,
and `success_count` on chain. Future work: build indexed leaderboards
with time-decay, per-category rankings, and discovery UIs so customers
can find top-performing public agents.

### 10.4. Agent compute marketplace

Sell spare CTO bare-metal cluster capacity to third-party agent runs,
metered and settled via the same program. Extends the billing primitive
from internal to external.

### 10.5. Multi-agent splits per task

The hackathon build supports one agent package per task. Future: a task
invokes multiple agent packages, and the program splits payment across
all of them atomically (N-way split in one Solana transaction).

## 11. Hackathon deliverables

1. **Anchor program** deployed to Solana devnet implementing:
   `initialize_operator`, `register_agent_package` (with `content_hash`),
   `update_agent_package`, `create_customer_account`, `deposit`,
   `withdraw`, `settle_task`, `refund_task`, `update_spending_caps`,
   `pause/unpause`.
2. **CLI or script** that simulates the full flow: register an agent
   package → create customer → deposit USDC → run a task with the public
   agent → settle with quality met (author gets paid) → run another task
   → settle with quality NOT met (customer not charged, author earns
   nothing) → verify receipts on chain.
3. **Demo video** showing:
   - Author registers an agent package on chain.
   - Customer deposits USDC into balance PDA.
   - CTO task runs using the public agent (can be mocked or real CodeRun).
   - Quality threshold met → settlement fires, payment splits between
     5D Labs treasury and agent author wallet. `TaskReceipt` shows
     `quality_met = true` and `author_earned > 0`.
   - Second task with quality NOT met → customer balance unchanged, author
     earns nothing. `TaskReceipt` shows `quality_met = false`.
   - Customer verifies both receipts in Solana explorer.
   - Customer withdraws remaining balance.
4. **This PRD** and the companion ideas doc (`docs/solana-hackathon-ideas.md`)
   as supporting documentation.

## 12. Success criteria

- A judge can watch the demo video and understand: a customer paid for
  AI agent work, a third-party agent author got a quality-gated royalty
  split, and the full flow settled on Solana with verifiable receipts.
- The program compiles, deploys to devnet, and passes basic integration
  tests (deposit, settle with split, settle with quality failure, refund,
  withdraw, cap enforcement, agent package registration).
- The marketplace is not a separate system — it's a conditional branch
  in `settle_task`, demonstrating that billing + marketplace are one
  program.
