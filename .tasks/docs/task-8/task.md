## Build Sigma-1 Website (Blaze - Next.js 15/React 19/Effect)

### Objective
Build the Sigma-1 public website using Next.js 15 App Router, React 19, shadcn/ui, TailwindCSS 4, and Effect 3.x. Implements equipment catalog browsing with real-time availability, self-service quote builder, Morgan web chat widget, project portfolio gallery, and AI-native optimizations (llms.txt, Schema.org). Deployed to Cloudflare Pages. Uses sidebar navigation on desktop, responsive collapse on mobile.

### Ownership
- Agent: blaze
- Stack: Next.js 15/React 19/TailwindCSS 4/Effect 3.x
- Priority: high
- Status: pending
- Dependencies: 2, 7

### Implementation Details
1. Initialize Next.js 15 project at apps/website using create-next-app with App Router, TypeScript, TailwindCSS 4. Install: shadcn/ui (latest), effect@3.x, @effect/schema, @tanstack/react-query v5, next@15, react@19, tailwindcss@4, @cloudflare/next-on-pages.
2. Create shared Tailwind config package at packages/design-tokens/tailwind.config.ts. Define: colors (sigma1 brand palette — dark background, accent electric blue/cyan per Stitch artifacts), spacing scale, border radii, font families (Geist or Inter). Export as module. Import in both apps/website and apps/mobile.
3. shadcn/ui initialization: npx shadcn-ui init with New York style, TailwindCSS 4. Install components: Button, Card, Badge, Sheet, Sidebar, Dialog, Select, Input, Skeleton, Avatar, Table, Tabs.
4. App Router structure: app/layout.tsx (root layout with sidebar nav), app/page.tsx (hero + value prop + CTA), app/equipment/page.tsx (catalog browser), app/equipment/[id]/page.tsx (product detail + availability), app/quote/page.tsx (quote builder), app/portfolio/page.tsx (event gallery), app/llms.txt/route.ts (static text route), app/llms-full/route.ts (full content route).
5. Effect data fetching: create lib/api.ts defining Effect.Service ApiClient with base URL from NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL env var. Define Effect.Schema types for Product, Category, Availability, Opportunity matching backend response shapes. Use Effect.runPromise in server components or React Query integration for client components.
6. Equipment catalog page: server component fetching GET /api/v1/catalog/categories and GET /api/v1/catalog/products. Client-side filtering by category, search input with debounce (300ms). Product cards with image (next/image pointing to R2 CDN URLs), name, day_rate, availability badge.
7. Product detail page (/equipment/[id]): fetch product details server-side. Client-side availability date picker (react-day-picker), calls GET /api/v1/catalog/products/:id/availability?from=&to= on date change via TanStack Query. Show quantity_available in real time. Add to Quote button.
8. Quote builder (/quote): client component. State: selected products (from equipment catalog), event dates, customer info. Effect.Schema validation on form fields. On submit: POST /api/v1/opportunities via RMS. Show confirmation with quote ID.
9. Portfolio (/portfolio): fetch GET /api/v1/social/published. Masonry grid of published event photos with lightbox (vaul or next/image modal). Event caption and hashtags displayed.
10. Morgan web chat widget: embed Morgan chat JS snippet in root layout.tsx as next/script (strategy=afterInteractive) pointing to http://morgan-chat-svc:3000/widget.js (via Cloudflare Tunnel public URL). Floating chat button, slide-up panel.
11. AI-native: app/llms.txt/route.ts returns plain text describing company, services, contact. app/llms-full/route.ts returns JSON dump of catalog categories, products summary. Add Schema.org JSON-LD in layout.tsx (Organization, LocalBusiness).
12. Sidebar navigation: shadcn/ui Sidebar component for desktop (> 768px). Mobile: Sheet-based hamburger menu. Nav links: Home, Equipment, Quote, Portfolio, Contact.
13. Cloudflare Pages deployment: wrangler.toml with pages_build_output_dir=.vercel/output/static. GitHub Actions workflow triggers next-on-pages build and wrangler pages deploy on push to main.
14. Environment variables: NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL (equipment catalog base), NEXT_PUBLIC_MORGAN_WIDGET_URL (Morgan chat endpoint).

### Subtasks
- [ ] Initialize Next.js 15 project at apps/website with TypeScript and TailwindCSS 4: Scaffold the Next.js 15 App Router project with all required dependencies installed and baseline configuration files in place.
- [ ] Create shared design tokens Tailwind config package at packages/design-tokens: Build the shared Tailwind configuration package defining the Sigma-1 brand palette, typography, spacing, and border radius tokens, importable by apps/website.
