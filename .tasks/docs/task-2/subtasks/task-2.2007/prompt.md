<scope>
Write GET /api/v1/equipment-api/catalog returning full catalog JSON with specs and availability windows, and POST /api/v1/equipment-api/checkout atomically validating availability and creating an availability_block row.
</scope>
</context>

<implementation_plan>
Create src/handlers/equipment_api.rs. GET /api/v1/equipment-api/catalog: query all products with category JOIN, include all fields (specs JSONB, image_urls, dimensions). For each product, compute a 30-day availability window (today to today+30) by fetching availability_blocks and calling compute_availability. Return structured JSON array: [{ id, name, category, specs, day_rate, availability_windows: [{ date, quantity_available }] }]. Use parallel queries per product or a single JOIN query with aggregation for performance — prefer single query with LEFT JOIN and GROUP BY. POST /api/v1/equipment-api/checkout: accept body { product_id: Uuid, date_from: NaiveDate, date_to: NaiveDate, quantity: i32, customer_id: Uuid }. Within a sqlx transaction: SELECT stock_quantity FROM products WHERE id = $1 FOR UPDATE. SELECT SUM(quantity_reserved + quantity_booked) FROM availability_blocks WHERE product_id = $1 AND date_from <= $3 AND date_to >= $2. If quantity_available < requested quantity return 409 Conflict with message. Otherwise INSERT INTO availability_blocks (product_id, date_from, date_to, quantity_reserved) VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4). Commit transaction. Return 201 with the created block id. Wire routes in main.rs.

<validation>
GET /api/v1/equipment-api/catalog returns HTTP 200 JSON array where each item contains specs and availability_windows fields. POST /api/v1/equipment-api/checkout with valid product and available dates returns HTTP 201 with block id. POST checkout for same product/dates where quantity would exceed stock returns HTTP 409. POST checkout with two concurrent requests for the last available unit — exactly one succeeds (201) and one returns 409, verifying FOR UPDATE locking.
